          <p>
            Hello! I'm a passionate gameplay programmer and software engineer. I work mainly with Unity, but I can also work with Godot and Unreal.
            <br><br>
            I always had a passion for video games since young and loved playing them. So, I got interested on how they were made!
            <br><br>
            I enjoy blending creativity with technology and love working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in gaming.
          </p>

          In this internship, I collaborated with a team of workers in various areas, like programmers, artists, and game and sound designers.
          I worked with Unity and C# to develop various projects where I did game and level designing and programmed gameplay mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these projects, I was able to improve my familiarity with Unity, my adaptability working with existent projects (by refactoring and adding new features), and my teamwork by collaborating with other colleagues and attending meetings.
